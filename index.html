I have a Certificate III in IT from 2006 but am mostly self-taught. Experience is mainly around corporate support and infrastructure management. My spare time is mainly spent with the family, playing video games or pretending I know how to play guitar.</p>

							Info:</p>
							<p>My name is Shaylea Smith student s3759647. I was born in Queensland and have lived her my entire life. I currently live in Ipswich and work as a Principal Custome Service Officer within the Department of Transport. I have two young children 9 and 7 who inspire me every day to reach for the stars. I first developed an interest in IT when my dad showed my GoogleAds for his business and how they worked, he has inspired me and encouraged me to complete my degree in this field to be able to progress my career into something that will be meaningful and able to help so many people. The only real experience I have in the IT world is that of working with multiple programs in order to complete my daily tasks at work. I look forward to working in our group "Inspired" and learning from each team member the skills and interests they bring to our team.</p>

							Info:</p>
							<p>I was born in Cook Town and moved around Queensland a bit before eventually ending up in Perth. I have played a fair bit of rugby union, though as much as I’d like to play again, a knee injury prevents that; so, I settle for going to the gym. Right now, I have had very little experience in the IT industry, only working in a computer repair store for a week during High school. But, like most, I have lived my life being surrounded by technology and I have developed a desire to make a career with technology at its centre.</p>

The focus of this position is to work closely with the business units to gain in-depth understanding of customer’s business strategy, processes, services, roadmap and the context in which the business operates. This role will be key to understanding the documenting capabilities needed to address business challenges.</p>

<p>Matthew Johnson: Chief Information Officer<br/>
 	<p>Senior executive in an enterprise who works for the traditional information technology and computer systems that support enterprise goals. The Chief Information Officer of an organization is responsible for making executive decisions regarding to things such as the purchase of IT equipment or the creation of new systems, they are therefore responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. </p>

<p>Graham Hibbert: General Manager Information Technology<br/>
 	<p>Also known as Managing Directors or Chief Operating Officers, General Managers are tasked with overseeing daily business activities, improving overall business functions, training heads of departments, managing budgets, developing strategic plans, creating policies, and communicating business goals.</p>

<p>Inspired in Review<br/>
			<p>Team Comparison</p>
<p>Ideal Job<br/>
<p>Three team members from Inspired, have aspirations for senior leadership roles and one in software engineering for support of critical military applications. Matthew and Graham share a common element in their respective ideal jobs. Both aspire to manage and implement IT infrastructure crucial to the ongoing requirements of the workforce. It is the sole responsibility of a CIO/GMIT to make executive decisions and create strategic plans in regard to the IT infrastructure of their organisation. 
Although very similar Shaylea’s senior business analyst (SBA) role is responsible for developing the business cases to present to the management. SBA works closely with the business units to gain in-depth understanding of the functionality of processes and systems in the context of the organisation. The SBA then analyses the raw data and creates a new business case to present to senior leadership, in order to implement change to create increased efficiency. However, Anthony’s ideal occupation differentiates by being more technical in its application. A software engineer designs and develops programs and platforms to support critical areas such as the Department of The Defence.</p>

<p>Team Direction<br/>
<p>The members of team Inspired all share similar career plans. All members agree, finishing their Bachelor degree in Information and Technology will be the platform in which they build their career. Matthew has also shown interest in continued study to gain further knowledge in accounting and management. Recognition of the need to gain work place experience is also a similar element throughout the team, with all team member electing to gain employment in supporting roles.</p>
